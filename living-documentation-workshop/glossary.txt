## "Dispatching"

Dispatching is the procedure for assigning employees (drivers) or vehicles to customers requests, e.g. for parcel delivery or couriers.

With vehicle dispatching, requests are matched according to the order of the incoming requests and the proximity of vehicles to the target locations or routes. 

The main stake in dispatching is to increase revenue by fitting more service requests into each workday.

## "Fuel Card Monitoring"

Fuel Card Monitoring is the analysis of every incoming fuel card transaction in order to detect potential fuel card abnormal behavior by drivers. 

By looking for abuse patterns and by cross-checking facts from various sources, it reports anomalies that are therefore investigated by the fleet management team. 

For example, a client using Fuel Card Monitoring with the GPS fleet-tracking features is able to bust an employee for padding hours, falsifying timesheets, and stealing fuel, or buying non-fuel goods with the fuel card.

## "Preventative Maintenance"

Preventive maintenance consists of scheduled servicing, inspections, and vehicle repairs to prevent potential problems and maximize vehicle availability. 

Preventive maintenance is used to proactively avoid or reduce vehicle breakdowns and is based on time, mileage, engine hours, or gallons of fuel used. 

Preventive maintenance actions include vehicle inspection, lubrication, adjustment, cleaning, testing, repair, and/or worn parts replacement.
